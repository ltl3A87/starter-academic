  * Design and implement the advanced algorithm for key phrases extraction. (This work has been deployed in Forms, Teams as Word cloud insight to provide a visualization of responses for text questions. It recieved very positive feedbacks from the customers!)
  * Learning Analysis Semantics over Tabular Data via Conditional Formatting as Proxy. In this research project, we proposed a sophiscated method to encode the table context with good comprehension to numerical tabular data, which can select condition type, formatting type and critical values to automatically recommend conditional formatting visualization for human beings.  
  
  We will submit a paper to VLDB in November.
