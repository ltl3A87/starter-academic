My research interests include Natural Language Processing and Image Editing conditioned on text. Currently, I am a thesis-based CS master student in University of Waterloo supervised by Prof. Wenhu Chen. Collaborating with GPT-series and diffusion-based models, we are exploring the potentials of the popular large language and vision models in various tasks, designing efficient algorithm on existed or novel problem setting. Ultimately, I hope we can realize more controllable generation, grounding on truth or human intention.
